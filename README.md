# Digispark-Scripts
These are hand-written DigiSpark sketches for the Arduino IDE that use the DigiKeyboard.h library to make the DigiSpark act like a keyboard and perform different tasks. 


------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation
You can configure Digispark by following : https://gist.github.com/Ircama/22707e938e9c8f169d9fe187797a2a2c?permalink_comment_id=3561901 or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGmGBa-4cYQ&ab_channel=Seytonic. Then you can download one of these scripts and open them with Arduino IDE, modify according to your needs and then upload them to Digispark.
